<h1 align="center">1. Google Chrome</h1>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.google.com/chrome/static/images/homepage/laptop_desktop.png"><br>
  <i>"Fast, easy-to-use tools for browsing"</i>
</p><br><br>

**Supported OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS<br>

**Why to go for it:**<br>
&rarr; Good performance<br>
&rarr; Very customizable<br>
&rarr; Multiple platforms supported<br>
&rarr; Almost all extensions are compatible with Google Chrome<br>

**Why to avoid it:**<br>
&rarr; Memory usage is incredibly high<br>
&rarr; Collects user data

Although it can have some bad performance sometimes because of the memory usage, this does not mean that Google Chrome is a bad browser. It's the complete opposite!
Google Chrome is very expandable and many things can be done with it, from casual things as watching videos to web developing, it is a really good choice if you don't really care about Google knowing your data.

<h1 align="center">2. Mozilla Firefox</h1>
<p align="center">

  <i>"Do what you do online. Firefox Browser isnâ€™t watching."</i>
</p><br><br>

**Supported OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS<br>

**Why to go for it:**<br>
&rarr; Good privacy protection<br>
&rarr; **VERY** customizable<br>
&rarr; Multiple platforms supported + can sync between devices<br>

**Why to avoid it:**<br>
&rarr; A bit slower than other browsers

Firefox is a great browser and helped us since 2002 and it's getting better on each update, even though 2019 was not a good year for Mozilla. From version 90 and higher, it will alert you if your email address and/or password has been compromised by hackers in a data breach, it has an integrated adblocker and it has most features that you need in your normal routine.

<h1 align="center">3. Microsoft Edge</h1>
<p align="center">
  <img width="720" src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RWO1KZ" /><br>
  <i>"Unlock hybrid work and empower productivity"</i>
</p>

**Supported OS:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS<br>

**Why to go for it:**<br>
&rarr; Very good performance<br>
&rarr; You can clear your data completely whenever you want<br>
&rarr; Has a user-friendly interface<br>
&rarr; Good privacy protection<br>

**Why to avoid it:**<br>
&rarr; You can't uninstall it on Windows 10 or superior (at least not in normal ways)<br>
&rarr; Older computers have trouble running it

With a Chrome-like interface and lighter than Chromium itself, Microsoft Edge is really good in terms of performance and the configuration for Privacy and Security tab is good. It has normal functions a browser would have: password managers, adblockers, TTS support, and so on.

<h1 align="center">4. Brave</h1>
<p align="center">
  <img width="720" src="https://brave.com/static-assets/images/optimized/features/images/Browser-2-1.png" /><br>
  <i>"Browse privately. Search privately. And ditch Big Tech."</i>
</p>

**Supported OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS<br>

**Why to go for it:**<br>
&rarr; Extremely good performance<br>
&rarr; Sync with mobile feature<br>
&rarr; Integrated adblocker<br>
&rarr; Has a user-friendly interface<br>
&rarr; Extremely good privacy protection<br>

**Why to avoid it:**<br>
&rarr; Some features can be hard to understand

This is the browser I most used on my life and I personally love it. It has many features that can be easy to understand, but some of them just are hard to understand what they do. It has a sync feature which is just awesome, it's really useful. It still has some bad points, like the lack of extensions/add-ons, the Shields function can break some websites, and some of the features are still in beta.

<h1 align="center">5. Opera GX</h1>

  <i>"The browser for gamers"</i>
</p>

**Supported OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS<br>

**Why to go for it:**<br>
&rarr; Very good performance<br>
&rarr; Sync with mobile feature<br>
&rarr; Integrated adblocker<br>
&rarr; Very customizable<br>
&rarr; Good privacy protection<br>

**Why to avoid it:**<br>
&rarr; Confusing/distracting design<br>
&rarr; Hard to access some features

Opera GX is the best browser if you have games open and want to browse at the same time. It has a CPU/RAM limiter which does not let the browser use more than the limit you put down there, which is pretty good. The sync feature is kinda messy at the time but the other features like the adblocker and VPN functions are really good.
